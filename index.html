            Agriculture is one of the many things in the world taking part regenerating
            in terms of how most people practicing agriculture nowadays use technology.
            Despite this,technology has only enabled them in making their work easier and
            even though it has catered for some of the chalenges they face,there is still
            more to be done on that sector.Climate change is one of the chalenges affecting
            farmers and even though there are some solutions that have been solved using technology
            such as compesating for the farmers affected by the factors caused by climate change
            and also creating online apps that farmers can sell their products to companies such
            as Twiga,there are more problems than just lack of market and climate changes.

            However there are some of the challenges Kenya face to 
            make sure Kenyan farmers have the very best.Some of the challenges are however
            irreversable.For example statistics show that 1.4 millio tones
            of soil has been washed away by water in west pokot and intensified
            by draught and climate.These are things that have already occured and 
            cannot be reversed but something can be done to improve the current status.

        We have an Agricultural app that help farmers have their products bought at affordable
        prices.This is one of our main focus since we believe that most of the farmers are
        drifting from agriculture because of the amount they get after selling their products
        despite putting in the work.We want to maintain our farmers and help in cattering for
        the high demand high quality products which we believe we can give.
